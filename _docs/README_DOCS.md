## 🗑️ Can I delete these files?

**Yes!** These files are purely informational. The application works perfectly without them.

However, it's recommended to keep them for at least a few months while you're still getting familiar with the application.

## 📍 Back to main project

The main application files are in the parent directory (`../`).

To run the application:
```bash
cd ..
python menu_principal.py
```
